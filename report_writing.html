      <h2>What is Report Writing in Cybersecurity?</h2>
      <p>
        Report writing is a critical skill for ethical hackers and penetration testers. A well-structured report communicates technical findings, business risks, and remediation steps in a clear and professional manner. Whether you're working in bug bounty, consulting, or internal testing, the quality of your report reflects your expertise.

      <h2>üìë Key Elements of a Great Security Report</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Executive Summary:</strong> High-level overview for non-technical stakeholders</li>
        <li><strong>Methodology:</strong> How the test was conducted (tools, scope, dates)</li>
        <li><strong>Findings:</strong> Detailed vulnerabilities with technical evidence</li>
        <li><strong>Impact Assessment:</strong> Risk analysis (CVSS score, business impact)</li>
        <li><strong>Recommendations:</strong> Clear steps to fix each issue</li>
        <li><strong>Appendices:</strong> Logs, raw output, scripts (optional)</li>

      <h2>üß† Step-by-Step: Writing a Security Report</h2>

      <h3>Step 1: Plan Your Report</h3>
      <p>Before writing, organize your notes, screenshots, logs, and tool outputs. Decide your audience (technical vs. business).</p>

      <h3>Step 2: Write the Executive Summary</h3>
      <p>This section should be short (1-2 paragraphs) and describe the purpose of the test, overall security posture, and high-level findings.</p>

      <h3>Step 3: Define Scope & Methodology</h3>
      <p>List tested systems, dates, authorized targets, and tools used. Mention if the testing was black-box, gray-box, or white-box.</p>

      <h3>Step 4: Document Vulnerabilities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a consistent structure: Title, Description, Impact, Evidence, Recommendation</li>
        <li>Use headers and bullet points for readability</li>
        <li>Include PoC requests/responses or screenshots</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 5: Rate Risk & Impact</h3>
      <p>Use CVSS or custom scales to define severity: Low, Medium, High, Critical. Tie the impact to business logic when possible.</p>

      <h3>Step 6: Provide Remediation Steps</h3>
      <p>Include actionable, realistic advice tailored to the issue and environment (code fixes, config changes, etc).</p>

      <h3>Step 7: Review, Proofread, Format</h3>
      <p>Make sure the language is clear, professional, and error-free. Consistency and grammar matter.</p>

      <h2>üåê Real-World Example Snippet</h2>
      <pre><code>Finding: Unauthenticated Access to Admin Panel
URL: https://target.com/admin

Impact:
Attackers can access administrative functions without logging in.

Evidence (HTTP Request):
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com

Response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Welcome, admin!

Recommendation:
Implement proper authentication checks before granting access to /admin.</code></pre>
